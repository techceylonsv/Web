Yarlco is the dairy product arm of the Jaffna District Development Cooperative Society, based in Thirunelveli. It is a household name in the peninsula, trusted by the Jaffna people for the quality of its products.

Yarlco sources, on average, six thousand liters of milk from local farmers per day and makes a range of dairy products such as pasteurized packet milk (including non-fat), flavored milk - the chocolate milk being a local favorite, yogurt, ice cream, milk toffee, ghee, curd, and cottage cheese. The best part is that all these are sold at an exceptionally reasonable price.

However, the capacity of the processing facility is inadequate to process the entire volume of fresh milk Yarlco collects. With a view of expanding production and improving the duration of Yarlco products best-before period through the use of advanced processing technologies, the JDD Cooperative Society recently announced a new project. Tech Ceylon Social Ventures will provide critical technical consultancy in this exciting venture from tender evaluation and equipment installation to operation and maintenance once the new plant starts running.
