_Tech Ceylon Social Ventures_ collaboratively worked with the V3 Foundation, UK to provide an Incense stick making machine (Value Rs. 215,000) to Mannar Association for Rehabilitation of Differently Able People (MARDAP). The machine will enable the organisation&#8217;s members to be self- reliant and self-supportive. _Tech Ceylon_ Directors Nadarajah Senthilruban and Sayanthan Singarasa attended the machine handover event on behalf of _Tech CeylonÂ _on 09/12/17.

_Tech Ceylon_ is keen to work with charities, professionals, and individuals to bring foreign investment and modern technologies to Sri Lanka to stimulate the local economy of the north-east, and to re-launch the private sector eco-system that has dwindled drastically during the last three decades.
